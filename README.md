SonoAI
----
A TensorFlow and Keras-based model for detecting fetal brain tumors in ultrasound images.

----
Overview
----
SonoAI is an experimental deep learning project exploring whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can effectively learn from unevenly distributed datasets in a highly complex medical imaging domain — fetal brain tumor detection.

This project aims to push the limits of CNN generalization and augmentation strategies when data scarcity and imbalance are major challenges.

----
Requirements for recreating
----
- Python 3.10 - 3.12
- A CUDA(basically just Nvidia) supporting GPU(for GPU training)
- This [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/ultrasound-fetus-dataset) or any other medical Dataset
----
Project Goals
----
- Investigate the performance of CNNs on imbalanced medical datasets.
- Explore data augmentation and regularization techniques to improve generalization.
- Evaluate how model architecture depth and callback strategies affect training stability.
- Assess whether meaningful predictions can still emerge from limited, noisy ultrasound data.

----
Model Details:
----
- Frameworks: TensorFlow & Keras
- Core Model: Custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- 400k Parameters
- Batch size of 32
- 128 filters max.
- max. 1000 epochs (Early stopping)
- Used ~100 epochs until early_stopping(CPU)

----
Techniques Used:
----

	* Early Stopping
	* Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip, etc.)
	* Dropout and batch normalization
	* Custom callbacks for model monitoring
	* manually duplicating the pictures in the folder by flipping them

----
Results & Observations:
----
	* The model demonstrates surprisingly good learning capability even with such data.
	* with a testaccuracy of ~ 80% - 85% it's far from being good enough to be used in medical contexts
	* Heavy augmentation, a fairly big droputrate and careful tuning are essential to avoid overfitting.
	*

----
Future Work:
----
	* Add the Benign Class to the model (extending to Multiclass Classification)
	* Add real-time class recognition
	* Make a GUI version and convert it into an .exe file

----
Disclaimer:
----
This is my first Project working with AI therefore results won't be very good

I did not create the dataset required for the CNN.

This project is not intended for any use besides research.
